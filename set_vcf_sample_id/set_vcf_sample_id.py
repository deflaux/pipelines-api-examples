# set_vcf_sample_id.py
#
# This script processes a single sample VCF file and replaces the
# sample ID in the header line.
#
# This could be replaced (almost) with a one-line sed script:
#
#   sed -e 's/\(^#CHROM\t.*\t\)original$/\1new/' \
#
# What this script adds is a little more control, notably with error
# handling. sed will not report the number of changes, so to determine
# if a change was made, you'd need to make a second pass over the file.
#
# This script reads from stdin and writes to stdout.
#
# Usage:
#   python set_vcf_sample_id.py original_id new_id
#
# If the original_id is specified, it will be verified before making the change.
# If the original_id is set to "", verification will be skipped.
